### functional component: is a function produce JSX

### class component: can aware itself when it is renderred

## State
### Each class based component has its own state object.
### Whenever a component's state changes, the component immediately re-renders.
### And also forces all its children to re-render as well.
### Before we use the state of a component, we need to initialize the state object.
